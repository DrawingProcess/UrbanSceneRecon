# Urban Scene Reconstruction

<!--

## Overall
This repository focuses on Large Scene Reconstruction in Autonomous Driving. Our group belongs to [Pseudo3DV](https://github.com/Pseudo-Lab/Pseudo3DV). </br>
This curated collection of resources is related to tackling real-world challenges in autonomous driving perception using NeRF (Neural Radiance Fields) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS).

Furthermore, we are currently operating a paper and code review study in [PsuedoLab](https://discord.gg/mNAT2GKM). Go check it out!
(Every Tuesday at 9pm, PseudoLab Discord Room YL!) ðŸš—ðŸ’¡
